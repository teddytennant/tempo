"""Conservative prize-card deduction (ported from masamikobayashi's Gold-Medal Starmie notebook).

Our search was fed a garbage belief state: it determinized the hidden deck as the first N cards of
the static decklist, so it "found" lines using cards that are actually in hand / discard / prized
(the NOMATCH failure). This tracker infers exactly which of our cards are prized so the search only
explores reproducible lines. It deliberately returns *unknown* when ambiguous — a wrong prize
inference is worse than none.
